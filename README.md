ABRAhaM
=======

Automatic Bing! Rewards Accounts Manager

This is a little project of mine that I've been tinkering with lately.  

ABRAhaM is a different approach to sealemar's repo 'https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards'
 which is a script that automates BING Rewards account daily searches and other
bonus tasks each day to get the max free daily bing rewards points.  These points
can be used to purchase items from their catalog like 5 bucks on your Amazon account, 
5 bucks off of a pizza from Dominos, music downloads, drawings for bigger prizes, 
and much more.  Rewards are earned every week or two if you get max bonus points 
for each day.  This code is meant to be a true STAND ALONE....as in it will run even 
if you arent home.....

I really liked the approach sealmar took on using Python to scrape and interact with
data on Bing.com.  Anyone who has tried to use python to do anything other than search 
on BING knows how much of a pain that can be for some people.  I'm creating ABRAhaM 
based on that script.  A few features added/subtracted/changed and I'm rewriting each
action in my own way to get familiar with each piece of code but any kudos on the idea
should go to sealemar.  His active code is located [HERE](https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards "Bing Rewards Repo")

I'll be updating the Version.txt file soon to show the updates/modifications I'm working on.  
One of the biggest differences you'll see here is I'm implimenting GUI's for Configuration, and interactions with the script.  You'll have a handy pretty window to perform any tasks you may need to do.
