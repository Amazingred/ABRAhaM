PENDING TODO LIST BY SCRIPT

CONFIGUI.PY
    THIS SCRIPT IS IN THE TESTING AND DEBUGGING PHASE
    ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL SMALLER FEATURES I WILL BE ADDING, THE MAIN FUNCTIONALITY IS DONE

	*Add a saved file checker operation that will check to see if the data has been saved to file upon attempting to exit
	*Add a configuration file archive/backup scheme so that I can automatically store previous versions of the config file whenever a new file is being saved in case of a need to rollback.
	*Change the password values from shown to hidden in the accounts editor.
	*Consider adding confirmation boxes upon changing account or preference settings.
	*ALWAYS insert self.status message updates EVERYWHERE in the script when the operation changes

ABRAhaM_DOC.py
    *Update the vital storage information (i.e version, date, url, bingpage, usage, helpmessage, etc)
    *Transfer over all of the text identifiers from the configui script and call them via the abedocs (soon to be docs) operation.  This should unclutter the configui script a lot!
